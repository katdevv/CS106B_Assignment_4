# CS106B Assignment 4

This is the fourth assignment of the **CS106B: Programming Abstractions** course from Stanford.

This assignment consists of the following problems:
- **Boggle** - a classic word game where players try to find as many words as possible by connecting adjacent letters on a 4x4 or 5x5 grid.
- In this implementation, the player competes against the computer, which (most of the time) finds far more words than a human is capable of.
